# This is my first React Native app

I know the Reactive  has been around for around a year, it's now on the
0.25 version, But i wasn't at all a fan of this hybrid kind of frameworks for mobile
device, i always prefered a native approach.

Since it's being talked around as the future unified language, i went to give it a try.

So this project will be used mainly for playing around with the framework. It could have
some architectural mistakes but will be addressed as the time come, and i learn with my
own mistakes.

besides beeing a playground for me, let make it usefull anyway.
The goal of the project is to display Departure boards from the Railway stations in London.
For that i will use the National RailWay Enquiry (NRE), which beeing a SOAP API its already
making my head hurting even from the getgo.


Enjoy!!


NOTES:
Also this will be used for trying the NuclIDE (from Facebook) which is said the best IDE for Ractive.
I will Give my feedback here as soon as i have an opinion on it.
